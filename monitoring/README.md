## Monitoring

* Learn how to setup local Grafana to monitor the production applications, [here](./setup-grafana-local.md).
* Get access to [Zabbix](https://zabbix.devshift.net:9443/zabbix/index.php) which looks after all the dependent services and also monitors production services.
* The [error tracking service](https://errortracking.prod-preview.openshift.io/openshift_io/) - Sentry keeps track of all the errors sent it's way by the running applications in prod and prod-preview.
